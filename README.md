# MicroJava Disassembler

## Introduction

An Angular web application for disassembling MicroJava object files.
You can find more about MicroJava and the compiler which generates object files [here](https://github.com/DanijelAskov/microjava-compiler).

MicroJava Disassembler is up and running.
Check it out [here](https://danijelaskov.github.io/microjava-disassembler/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
